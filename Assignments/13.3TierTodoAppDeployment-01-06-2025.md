# üìò Assignment: 3-Tier Application Deployment on Azure

## üéØ Objective:

Deploy a full-stack 3-tier application on Azure consisting of:

* A **React Frontend** hosted on a **Frontend VM**
* A **Python FastAPI Backend** hosted on a **Backend VM**
* An **Azure SQL Database** (PaaS) as the data storage layer

All three tiers should communicate over public IPs (for learning/demo purposes).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Azure SQL Database Setup (PaaS)

1. Create a new **Azure SQL Server** and **SQL Database**.
2. Configure **firewall rules** to allow traffic from the Azure VMs.
3. Note down the **connection string** and credentials for use in the backend.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Backend Deployment (Python FastAPI on VM)

1. Create a **Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04)** on Azure and assign a **Public IP**.
2. Install required packages:

   * Python, `pip`, `uvicorn`, `msodbcsql17`, and `unixODBC`
3. Clone the given FastAPI backend repo and update the `app.py` with your Azure SQL connection string.
4. Run the FastAPI app using:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
5. Verify that API endpoints are working at:

   ```
   http://<Backend_Public_IP>:8000/api/tasks
   ```

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Frontend Deployment (React on VM)

1. Create a **Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04)** on Azure and assign a **Public IP**.
2. Install Node.js, NPM, and Nginx.
3. Clone the React frontend repo.
4. Update the `src/TodoApp.js` file to point to your backend public IP and port.
5. Build the app using:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
6. Deploy the build artifacts to `/var/www/html/` using Nginx.
7. Access the app via:

   ```
   http://<Frontend_Public_IP>
   ```

## üì∏ Submission Instructions

Submit the following for verification:

1. Screenshot of your **Azure SQL Database** configuration.
2. Screenshot showing **API response** from `http://<Backend_Public_IP>:8000/api/tasks`.
3. Screenshot of the **React frontend** loading in the browser and showing data.
4. IP addresses of:

   * Frontend VM
   * Backend VM
5. GitHub URLs of the frontend and backend repos you used.

## üìå Notes:

* This is a real-world cloud deployment simulation.
* Make sure all ports (80, 8000) are allowed in NSGs.
* Use public IPs only for learning. In production, use VNet, private IPs, and Azure Private Link.
